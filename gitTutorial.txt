command line commands
must be in git repository for git commands to work

ls for mac, dir for windows (lists everything inside your directory)
cd (cd ... is like backspace)

git status (highlight differences between cloud and local workspace)
untracked file (exists in one place but not the other)
git add -A (syncs all untracked files: not uploaded yet but git known they exists now)
git commit -m "add message here"
(if you dont add -m and "message" it glitches -> hit escape, ":wq")
git push
git pull
